# DiabetesPrediciton-SVM
The porject main aim to make diabetes pediction system using python and svm machine learning classifier.
The data is to train the machine is taken form PIMA DATASET from kaggle.
Then we do all the steps which are done with the data set before training with to machine, like data pre-processing, identifying null value, etc..
Above can be done by using the heat map and corealtion matrix.
Then we train our machine once the machine is trained the we can use it succefully to identify the patient has diabetes or not
The machine take 8 factors as input to tell the patient has diabetes or not.
The Eight Factors are as below:-
1.Pregnancy 	
2.Glucose 	
3.Blood Pressure 	
4.Skin 
5.Insulin 	
6.BMI
